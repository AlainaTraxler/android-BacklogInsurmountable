#### By _**Alaina Traxler**_

## Description

_An app that allows the tracking of retro games (NES only, at the moment) and whether or not they have been completed_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download from https://github.com/eloavox/android-BacklogInsurmountable and run in Android Studio v 2.21 or higher_

## Known Bugs

_Functionality is largely limited,w ith most elements serving as placeholders. Data persistance and database integration are both lacking. Recycling of views in BacklogActivity causes a bug in which games are marked completed when they are not. Database integration will solve this, as currently the only way to track the list items is by id._
